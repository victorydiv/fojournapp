## 3. **Inline Approval Actions**
- **Approve Button**: Green "Approve" button for each pending experience
- **Reject Button**: Red "Reject" button for each pending experience
- **Instant Updates**: Approved experiences immediately appear in main itinerary

## 4. **Enhanced Notifications System**
- **Bell Icon**: Shows combined count of invitations + pending suggestions
- **Notification Breakdown**: Displays both counts separately in dropdown
